                    <h2 id="one.one">1.1 Document Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of READ. It will explain the goals of the project, the features implemented, the navigation of the user interface and finally the limitations and future-proofing aspects of this project.</p>
                    <h2 id="one.two">1.2 Product Scope</h2>
                    <p>The objective of the project is to create a web application to manage course materials for a class, track user’s face when reading study materials and provide important statistics based on it. There will be students’ and teachers’ portals, where the students can enroll in many courses and track their assignments and schedules all in one place. The teachers can share study materials and keep record of who actually read through everything using facial recognition and eye tracking and generate statistics for every individual class.</p>
                    <p>The main benefit associated with using this product is the unique feature which allows teachers to get back statistics on their students. Being able to evaluate the effectiveness of particular documents and understanding which type of study materials make students intrigued about a topic are among the myriad gaols of this product.</p>
                    <h2 id="one.three">1.3 Intended Audience and Document Overview</h2>
                    <p>This document is intended for the professor, project managers and developers who will find the list of functions and requirements needed for developing this application.
                    This document does not illustrate any specific points of failure and uses some technical terms, so it may be less useful to testers and business managers. Section 3.2 of this document contains detailed description of the functionalities mentioned in section 2.2. Use case model is illustrated in section 3.3. The reader can jump to the relevant parts of the document as necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="one.four">1.4 Document Conventions</h2>
                    <p>This document follows the IEEE formatting requirements. Each section and subsection have been divided and numbered to distinguish them. Special terms and comments are in italics.</p>
                    <h2 id="one.five">1.5 Document References and Acknowledgements</h2>
                    <p>This document makes no explicit references apart from the use of the IEEE format for writing the document.

                    <h2 id="two.one">2.1 Product Overview</h2>
                    <p>The development of this product is primarily to be able to create a useful service for students and teachers, but also due to the necessity of a project for our course. This project does not follow on from any existing product, but is being built from scratch as a first iteration of a new product.</p>
                    <p>READ is designed to be an application for teachers and students, which is to be deployed as a website and as an android application. It acts as a powerful tool for teachers to maintain different classes of pupils and the course materials shared. READ allows teachers to check and verify (using facial recognition and eye tracking) who has read and completed their assigned tasks and aggregate statistics of class performance based on the records.
                    </p>
                    <p> The front end will be a series of web pages and the back end will consist of a database system and a web server to run the program. Webcam will be accessed to track the users’ face and eyes.

                    <h3>3.1.1	User Interfaces</h3>
                    <p>The user interface will be several webpages each for a different task. The layout will be created using the help of any existing template. </p>

                    <ol>  <li> Registration and Login page - allows the user to register and create an account in the web application. If account already exists, the user will log in to their respective accounts.
                        </li>
                        <li> Dashboard page - the main page that will hold each user’s personal information and record of number of classes enrolled in. This includes a side menu bar that links to other pages.
                        </li>
                        <li>  Classroom page - this page holds all the course materials or assignments of a specific class posted by a teacher and can be viewed by both students and teachers.
                        </li>
                        <li> Statistics page - this page can only be accessed by the teacher to see detailed information of class performance.

                    </ol>
                    <h3> 3.1.2	Hardware Interfaces </h3>
                    This product does not require any hardware interface because it is entirely enclosed within the bounds of a web application.
                    <h3>   3.1.3	Software Interfaces</h3>
                    The majority of the web interface will be written in Html, Css and JavaScript, and so will not require any specialized software to run other than an up-to-date web browser. Django will be used as the framework to handle the backend which includes the database system and run the program.
                    Additionally, a facial recognition API shall be used to meet the basic functionality of the product.

                    <h2 id="four.one">4.1 Performance Requirements</h2>
                    <p>The website should be efficient on memory and loading times. Every page must load within a second.</p>
                    <h2 id="four.two">4.2 Safety and Security Requirements</h2>
                    <p>The website, once deployed on a web server rather than a local host, should get an HTTPS connection certificate, in order to ensure when a user enters the website, they know their data is secure and the connection is encrypted.
                    </p>
                    <p> As this website will contain personal data regarding its users, security must be maintained. Users should be cautioned from putting sensitive data anywhere, and their passwords will be stored in hashed form in order to prevent brute-force access to their accounts. Users and Administrators should also be discouraged from sharing their account credentials, to prevent data breaches.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="four.three">4.3 Software Quality Attributes</h2>
                    <p>The main requirements here is that the system is straightforward and easy to use, therefore having good usability.
                    </p>
                    <p> The main security concern here is user’s login information so a proper login mechanism must be used to avoid hacking.

                    <h3>1.Federated User Credentials </h3>

                    <p> In addition to making their own accounts whose credentials are stored in the project’s database, users will have the option of using their Google accounts to log in. As Google is one of the largest and widely used platforms on the internet. This would reduce the hassle for a new user of the website and improve ease of access.
                    Again, security must be maintained on both the developers’ and users’ side, in order to ensure the users do not suffer any security breaches regarding their Google account.
